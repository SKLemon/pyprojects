# ! Morality Clause for the Automated Birthday Wisher

"""
This automated birthday wisher is meant to remind you of birthdays and catch those "Oh no!" moments before they happen.
It's not here to replace human connections and a program emailing "Happy Birthday!" isn't quite the same as calling your loved one...
Additionally, who emails "Happy Birthday" messages nowadays...

If you believe birthdays should always be remembered the old-fashioned way, feel free to pick up the phone and dial away!
This program just ensures you never get hit with the "Oh no, I forgot!" panic again.
Use responsibly, and when in doubt, add a personal touch â€” because even a robot knows that friendships shouldn't be fully automated.
