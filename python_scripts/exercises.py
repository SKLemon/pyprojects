# Lists
# Generally, since lists are a collection or group of objects, better to give them plural names
# square brackets designate a list
# dogs = ['border collie', 'australian cattle dog', 'labrador retriever']
# dog = dogs[0]
# print(dog.title()).title

languages = ["python", "C", "java"]
print(f"A nice programming language is {languages[1]}.")

# Loops
# Examining the for loop anatomy using a code block
# for dog in dogs:
# print(dog)
# Keyword "for" tells python to get a 'for loop' going
# First keyword dog (with no s) is a temporary placeholder value. Python will place each item in the list into this placeholder, one at a time.
# First time through the loop, it will output border collie#
# Second time, it will output australian cattle dog ad so on.
# Once there are no more items in the loop, the loop will end
