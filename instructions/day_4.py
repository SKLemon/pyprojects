import random
#Allows to get random whole numbers
random_integer = random.randint(1,10)
print(random_integer)

#Allows to get random decimal numbers between 0 and 1.
randomFloat = random.random()
print(randomFloat)

# Also allows to increase the range of random decimal numbers through math operators
# Ex. random_float * 5 would result in a random decimal number between 0 and 5
